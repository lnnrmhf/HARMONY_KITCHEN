# HARMONY KITCHEN
Cozy retro mini-game centering around cultural exchange and ultimately peace through the shared love of food.

This is my first big coding project and final project of the introductory course “programming for astrophysicists”. We were given the option to choose between three topics and I chose "orld peace". Else, there were no specifications on what the project was supposed to be. I wanted to experiment with pygame, so I decided to make this little mini-game. Since I only started learning Python a few months ago, the code is a little rough and the game has some aesthetic issues. Nevertheless, it works and I am happy with how it turned out.
